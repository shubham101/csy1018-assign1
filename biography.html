                After doing much research about colleges which have standard academic stands on IT department. I am applying to NAMI College because of the Standard reputation, Superb facilities and the exceptional reviews that I have read from other recent graduates. Unlike others Institutions, NAMI has its partnership with the Northampton University and to get an international degree is like dream come true.
                Currently, I am just beginning my journey and ready to dive into the undergraduate studies program. My ultimate goal is to finish the IT program at NAMI College. Once I have completed my Bachelor’s on IT, I would be looking forward to complete my Master's level on abroad.

Once I have completed my Bachelor’s on IT, I would be looking forward to complete my Master's level on abroad. I am sure this is correct path, as I grew up in a family where my father is a Engineering and my mother had worked on some Social organisations like UN, and currently is one of the Board members of "Pure Drinking Water Nepal". Considering both of my parents, I feel like I would be honoring them and their dedication to helping others by entering this field.
