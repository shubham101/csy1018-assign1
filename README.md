Getting Started

To get an idea, I went through lots of tutorial. I started my Portfolio after doing a lot of research. I noticed many were made through Bootstrap or HTML5. I started making my webpage using simple CSS fonts. Later I made it more attractive after getting familiar with it. But I felt a bit difficult while I was making my web pages responsive. This assessment is about developing an interactive web page design using HTML, CSS properties. The major purpose for this report is to assign all the details while developing my webpage using HTML5 and CSS properties and my experience while making my webpages and I have also included screenshots of my all web pages.

Sketches Homepage

I have made my Homepage very general in look, user friendly so it could be very easy for user to use it. I have put my basic details on my Home page. On my Home page, I have also included a search bar where user can find some stuff about the page details. I have a pic of mine so the users can recognise me. I have put unique panel just above the footer where users are able to click the buttons like they have “Back to Top” & “Next Page” where back to top will take them to the “top of the page” & “next page” will take them to next page.



Sketches About

On my Biography page, I have included about myself and somewhat of details of my life. I have also cited about my interest to the programming. Same as homepage I have put the navigation, search bar and the footer part in about page too.

Conclusion

At the end of my project I learned a lot from w3 school and used a lot of code from it. Some of my parts were difficult to handle but most problem was revered with consulting with my tutor. I have covered almost all the parts from the given example. And I tried to make my page as good as I could. I felt responsive part was a bit difficult. Overall this was a good experience and I learned a lot from my project.
